# Author instructions
Author instructions for Beni Selyem, made for *ACS - Assignment 2a: Author instructions* as part of the Research Project course.

## Basic structure
The research paper is going to follow the general IMRAD structure, since the research activity itself closely follows the general structure of other experimental research setups.

1. The first page is going to be a title page presenting short information about the project, author and thesis committee.
2. The next section is going to be the abstract that shortly details the research, methods and outcomes.
3. The introduction is going to give a more precise introduction to the topic, and the results.
4. The next section is going to be the background that will give even more details regarding the topic and previous work.
5. The next section is going to be the method that described the experimental setup and the tools and data used.
6. The next section is going to be the results, writing about the results of the experiment described in the previous section.
7. The next section is going to be about responsible research.
8. The next section is going to be the discussion & future work section that is going to reflect on the results and the experiment itself.
9. The final section will be the conclusion section.
10. At the end of the paper a list of references follows.
11. Depending on whether or not there is need for it appendices follow.

## General rules
* Text should be grammatically correct, use a spell checker to ensure this
* Abbreviations should be first introduced in long form unless they are common in the field.
* Paper should include images when suitable to support understanding
* Paper should be in 2 column format
* Paper should not exceed 8 pages excluding references and appendices
* Paper should be based on the provided university template in certain aspects, such as font size and style

## Title page
I don't see a reason to deviate from the provided template.
* Mention the title and subtitle of the project
* Mention the author and responsible professor of the project
* Mention the examiner of the project
* Provide a university issued email address for each of the mentioned people whenever possible.
* Provide the university logo and other boilerplate text provided by the template.

## Abstract
* Should be relatively short 1-2 sections.
* Should introduce the topic
* Should describe briefly the experiment method
* Should briefly mention the most interesting experiment results
* Should shortly mention the conclusion.

## Introduction
* Should describe the topic a bit
* Should show relevant past work in the field and refer to it
* Should establish the scientific gap/the problem that this paper is going to investigate
* Should give the main research question and the related sub-questions.
* Should give the main contributions
* Should give a quick overview of the rest of the paper

## Background
* Should describe the field in more detail
* Should explain all concepts that may not be familiar to someone not working in the field
* Should go more in depth about relevant work and give references
* To wrap up should reiterate the scientific gap one more time

## Method
* Should describe in detail the applications that will be tested
* Should describe in detail how my tracer works (what sort of data does it collect, does it do any processing on the data, how does it work in case of multiple processes threads, are there any quirks)
* Should give a description of the experiment environment used (OS, kernel version, test programs, test programs version - commit hash if possible)
* Should give a description of the evaluated tools. This doesn't need to be detailed but will refer to the papers that go in detail about those tools
* Should mention that single phase execution and multi phase execution is investigated separately.
* Should mention how the evaluated tools were ran (which parameters & configuration)
* Should mention what kinds of data are recorded, how they are recorded and how they are aggregated.

## Results
* Should mention all results for all tools including my own and the evaluated ones.
* Should include *negative results* such as compile or runtime failures, timeouts, or a tool not being able to be ran in the first place.
* Should report results objectively and defer discussions and interpretations or theories to the discussion & future work section.
* Should give the results in a table format and only highlight the more interesting results in natural language. The table should have a short description under it.

## Responsible research
* Should reflect on ethical and reproducibility concerns
* Can refer to the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity
* Should be brief to not distract from the main topic

## Discussions & Future work
* Should give interpretations of the results and theories explaining the observed data.
* Should give apparent advantages and drawbacks/short comings of the various tools based on the data.
* Should give potential future work in the area based on the observations from the data.

## Conclusions
* Should point out the answer to the main research question and its sub-questions based on the results and their discussion.
* Should summarize the previous sections in a very short manner.
* Should highlight the contributions based on the results.

## References
* Should use the IEEE style of referencing
* Should use bibtex for automatic reference generation and citations
* Should provide references only when they are cited
* Should not count towards the total page limit

## Appendices
* Should be an optional section depending on whether I have data that requires this
* Should provide data in the order the preceding text refers to it
* Should contain any data that is too large or would break the flow of the paper but would be nice to include/refer to.
* Should not count towards the total page limit
